    <h1>December 16th Challenge</h1>

    <p>
      This is a math question I got on a test before <br />
      I still remember it because the solution is pretty
      cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Draw a circle on a page. First, draw a straight line
      that passes through the center of the circle (a
      diameter). Then draw a second straight line at a
      random location and angle such that every point in the
      circle is equally likely to lie on this line. What is
      the probability that the two lines intersect inside
      the circle?
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternative wording (by chatgpt): Draw a circle on a
      page. First, draw a straight line that goes through
      the center of the circle (a diameter). Next, draw a
      second straight line at any angle, as long as the line
      touches the circle. What is the probability that the
      two lines cross each other inside the circle?
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer should be in fraction form. <br />
      For example, if you believe the answer is 15% then
      that is 3/20

    <div class="answer-row">
      <input
        id="answer"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Enter fraction"
      />
      <button id="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div id="result"></div>
