    <h1>December 16th Challenge</h1>

    <p>
      This is a math question I got on a test before. <br />
      I still remember it because the solution is pretty
      cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      A circle is drawn on a page. A straight line is drawn
      through the center of the circle, forming a diameter
      with endpoints A and B. Second straight line is then
      drawn at a random angle and position so that every
      point in the circle is equally likely to lie on this
      line. The second line intersects the circle at points
      C and D. <br />
      What is the probability that the two lines intersect
      inside the circle?
    </p>

    <p>
      An example - fix the first line A,B arbitrarily. Then
      assume the second line is placed at random. The image
      shows different possible configurations of which only
      the line that intersects with the first is the one
      marked with the normal C and D endpoints.

    </p>

    <p>
      The answer should be in fraction form. <br />
      For example, if you believe the answer is 15% then
      that is 3/20

    <div class="answer-row">
      <input
        id="answer"
        type="text"
        placeholder="Enter fraction"
      />
      <button id="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div id="result"></div>
