    <h1>December 16th Challenge</h1>

    <p>
      This is a math question I got on a test before <br />
      I still remember it because the solution is pretty
      cool.
    </p>

    <p>
      A circle is drawn on a page. First, you draw a
      straight line that goes through the center of the
      circle from one side to the other. Then you draw a
      second straight line, also going through the center,
      but its angle is chosen at random. What is the chance
      that the two lines cross each other inside the circle?
    </p>

    <p>The answer should be in fraction form. <br>
      For example, if you believe the answer is 15% then that is 3/20
    </p>

    <div class="answer-row">
      <input id="answer" type="text" placeholder="Enter fraction" />
      <button id="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
    <div id="result"></div>

    <br />

  </body>
